echo "üìä ANALYSIS SUMMARY:"
echo ""
echo "1. Check the 'V5_VIEW_CURRENT_STATE' results:"
echo "   - If pct_with_budget is 0%, then no budgets are showing"
echo "   - Compare with historical 87.4% from August"
echo ""
echo "2. Check 'SOURCE_BUDGET_DATA_CHECK':"
echo "   - If this shows 0 records, the source budget data is missing"
echo "   - Check latest_sync_date to see if data is stale"
echo ""
echo "3. Check 'INDIVIDUAL_BUDGET_SUMMARY_TEST':"
echo "   - This tests the CTE logic that processes budget data"
echo "   - Should show individual budget records if source data exists"
echo ""
echo "4. Check 'JOIN_ANALYSIS':"
echo "   - Shows if work items with budgets are joining with latest work items"
echo "   - If 'Work items in both' is 0, the join is failing"
echo ""

echo "üõ†Ô∏è  POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS:"
echo ""
echo "If source budget data is missing:"
echo "   ./deploy_work_item_budget_vs_actual_sync.sh"
echo ""
echo "If join is failing:"
echo "   ./fix_v5_view_and_dimension_updates.sh"
echo ""
echo "If CTE logic is broken:"
echo "   Check the work_item_budget_vs_actual_corrected_view deployment"
echo ""

echo "üìß Next steps:"
echo "1. Review the diagnostic results above"
echo "2. Run the appropriate fix script based on findings"
echo "3. Re-run this investigation to confirm the fix"
